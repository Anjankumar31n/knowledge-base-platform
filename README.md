Project Description â€“ Knowledge Base Platform
The Knowledge Base Platform is a full-stack web application developed to emulate and extend the core functionalities of tools like Atlassian Confluence. It enables teams to create, manage, and collaborate on documents efficiently within a secure and user-friendly environment.

This platform includes:

User Authentication: Secure registration, login, and password recovery using email and JWT-based API security.

Document Management: Rich WYSIWYG editor for creating, editing, and auto-saving documents; global search and metadata display.

Collaboration Tools: @username mentions with auto-notification and automatic access sharing.

Privacy Controls: Support for public and private documents, with granular permission levels (view/edit).

Version Control (Bonus): Full version tracking with timestamps, change history, and side-by-side comparison of document revisions.

The platform was built using:

Backend: PHP (mysqli)

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Database: MySQL

Security: JWT-based authentication

Every feature from the assignment brief was implemented with attention to modular architecture, performance, and user experience. This project reflects both technical skills and a strong work ethic, having been built through focused, day-and-night effort.
